# Image Generation - Not Implemented

## Current Status

No backend implementation for image generation. Frontend has a complete UI with diffusion parameters but makes no API calls.

## Frontend State

### GenerateImagePage
- Complete UI with model selection and parameters
- Canvas displays placeholder image only
- No API integration implemented

### ImageRunSettingsPanel Controls
- Model selection dropdown (hardcoded options)
- Prompt and negative prompt text areas
- Aspect ratio selector
- Sliders for steps, CFG scale
- Sampler selection
- Seed input (-1 for random)

### Frontend State (Local Only)
```typescript
const [model, setModel] = useState<string>('sdxl');
const [negativePrompt, setNegativePrompt] = useState<string>('');
const [aspectRatio, setAspectRatio] = useState<string>('1:1');
const [steps, setSteps] = useState<number>(30);
const [cfgScale, setCfgScale] = useState<number>(7.5);
const [sampler, setSampler] = useState<string>('Euler');
const [seed, setSeed] = useState<number>(-1);
```

## Not Implemented

### Backend
1. No image generation endpoints
2. No integration with image generation services
3. No image storage or database models
4. No thumbnail generation
5. No image history or management

### Frontend
1. No API calls from image generation UI
2. No image loading or persistence
3. No history or gallery views
4. Canvas shows static placeholder only

## Potential Future Endpoints

If implemented, would likely follow this pattern:

```
POST /v1/images/generations    # Generate new image
GET  /api/images/              # List user's images
GET  /api/images/{id}/         # Get specific image
DELETE /api/images/{id}/       # Delete image
```

## Required for Implementation

### Backend Requirements
- Image generation service (Stable Diffusion, DALL-E, etc.)
- File storage system (local or cloud)
- Database models for image metadata
- Thumbnail generation
- API endpoints with streaming support

### Frontend Requirements
- API integration in GenerateImagePage
- Replace placeholder with actual generated images
- Add loading states during generation
- Error handling for failed generations
- Optional: Progress indicators for long generations

## Current Workaround

Users wanting image generation should use:
1. External image generation services
2. Local Stable Diffusion installations
3. Other AI image generation tools

The UI serves as a design prototype only.

# ðŸ§© Chat System Frontend Plan

## Purpose
Deliver a modern, streaming AI chat experience using React 19 and the Vercel AI SDK, with a responsive, accessible, and extensible UI.

---

## Core Components
- `ChatPlaygroundPage`: Main chat UI
- `useChat` (from `@ai-sdk/react`): Handles message state, streaming, abort, and UI updates
- `RunSettingsPanel`: Model selector, temperature, tool toggles
- `TokenCountMeter`: Displays prompt/completion/total tokens

---

## State Management
- Local state: Zustand for UI state (messages, model, temperature, etc.)
- Server state: React Query for models and chat completions

---

## API Integration
- Uses `/v1/chat/completions` for chat (streaming and non-streaming)
- Uses `/v1/models` for model listing

---

## Streaming
- Uses `useChat` to handle streaming responses from the backend.
- UI updates incrementally as tokens arrive.
- Supports abort/stop generation via AbortController.

---

## UI/UX
- Responsive, accessible design with theming (teal and lime-yellow)
- Keyboard shortcuts and ARIA support
- Error boundaries and toast notifications for error handling

---

## Extensibility
- Planned: persistent chat history, multi-session support, advanced tools (function calling, image generation)
- Easy integration of new models via `/v1/models`

---

## Data Contracts

### Chat Completion Request
```json
{
  "model": "llama3",
  "messages": [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hello"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hi there!"}
  ],
  "temperature": 1.0,
  "topP": 0.95,
  "tools": [],
  "stream": true
}
```

### Streaming Response
```json
// Each chunk:
data: {"choices":[{"delta":{"content":"Hello"}}]}
// ...
data: [DONE]
```

### Final Response (non-streaming or last chunk)
```json
{
  "id": "chatcmpl-123",
  "choices": [{
    "message": {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Hello! How can I help you today?"
    },
    "finishReason": "stop"
  }],
  "usage": {
    "promptTokens": 10,
    "completionTokens": 15,
    "totalTokens": 25
  }
}
```

---

## Implementation Priorities
1. Streaming chat UI with Vercel AI SDK
2. Model listing integration
3. Session persistence and history (future)
4. Usage tracking and analytics (future)

---

## Future Enhancements
- Persistent chat history and multi-session support
- Advanced tool calling and function execution
- Image, audio, and multimodal generation
- Usage analytics and billing integration
- Team/workspace support

---

**This plan is the single source of truth for the frontend chat system. All implementation and documentation should align with this architecture.**
